              "'Why should a small business be interested in, or concerned with information security? The customers of small businesses have an expectation that their sensitive information will be respected and given adequate and appropriate protection. The employees of a small business also have an expectation that their sensitive personal information will be appropriately protected. And, in addition to these two groups, current and/or potential business partners also have their expectations of the status of information security in a small business. These business partners want assurance that their information, systems, and networks are not put “at risk” when they connect to and do business with this small business. They expect an appropriate level of security in this actual or potential business partner – similar to the level of security that they have implemented in their own systems and networks. Some of the information used in your business requires special protection for confidentiality (to ensure that only those who need access to that information to do their jobs actually have access to it). Some of the information used in your business needs protection for integrity (to ensure that the information has not been tampered with or deleted by those who should not have had access to it). Some of the information used in your business needs protection for availability (to ensure that the information is available when it is needed by those who conduct the organization’s business). And, of course, some information used in your business needs protection for more than one of these categories of information security. Such information might be sensitive employee or customer information, confidential business research or plans, financial information, or information falling under special information categories such as privacy information, health information, or certain types of financial information. Some of these information categories have special, much more restrictive regulatory requirements for specific types of information security protections. Failure to properly protect such information, based on the required protections, can easily result in significant fines and penalties from the regulatory agencies involved. Just as there is a cost involved in protecting information (for hardware, software, or management controls such as policies & procedures, etc), there is also a cost involved in not protecting information. Those engaged in risk management for a small business are also concerned with cost-avoidance – in this case, avoiding the costs of not protecting sensitive business information. When we consider cost-avoidance, we need to be aware of those costs that aren’t immediately obvious. Among such costs are the notification laws that many states have passed which require any business, including small businesses, to notify, in a specified manner, all persons whose data might have been exposed in a security breach (hacker incident, malicious code incident, an employee doing an unauthorized release of information, etc). The average estimated cost for these notifications and associated security breach costs is well over $130.00 per person. If you have 1000 customers whose data might have been compromised in an incident, then your minimum cost would be $130,000, per incident. Prevention of identity theft is a goal of these laws/regulations. This should provide motivation to implement adequate security to prevent such incidents. Of course, if there is such an incident then some customers will lose their trust in the affected small business and take their business elsewhere. This is another cost that isn’t immediately obvious, but which is included in the above per-person cost. Considering viruses and other malicious code (programs); there were over 1.6 million new viruses and other malicious programs detected in 2008 (Symantec – Internet Security Threat Report, April 14, 2009).  It is unthinkable to operate a computer without protection from these harmful programs. Many, if not most, of these viruses or malicious code programs are used by organized crime to steal information from computers and make money by selling or illegally using that information for such purposes as identity theft. It is not possible for a small business to implement a perfect information security program, but it is possible (and reasonable) to implement sufficient security for information, systems, and networks that malicious individuals will go elsewhere to find an easier target. Additional information may be found on the NIST Computer Security web page at: http://csrc.nist.gov.Do not allow unauthorized persons to have physical access to or to use of any of your business computers. This includes locking up laptops when they are not in use. It is a good idea to position each computer’s display (or use a privacy screen) so that people walking by cannot see the information on the screen. Controlling access to your systems and networks also involves being fully aware of anyone who has access to the systems or networks. This includes cleaning crews who come into the office space at night to clean the trash and office space. Criminals often attempt to get jobs on cleaning crews for the purpose of breaking into computers for the sensitive information that they expect to find there. Controlling access also includes being careful about having computer or network repair personnel working unsupervised on systems or devices. It is easy for them to steal privacy/sensitive information and walk out the door with it without anyone noticing anything unusual. No one should be able to walk into your office space without being challenged by an employee. This can be done in a pleasant, cordial manner, but it must be done to identify those who do not have a legitimate reason for being in your offices. “How may I help you?” is a pleasant way to challenge an unknown individual.Employees who use any computer programs containing sensitive information should be told about that information and must be taught how to properly use and protect that information. On the first day that your new employees start work, they need to be taught what your information security policies are and what they are expected to do to protect your sensitive business information. They need to be taught what your policies require for their use of your computers, networks, and Internet connections. In addition, teach them your expectations concerning limited personal use of telephones, printers, and any other business owned or provided resources. After this training, they should be requested to sign a statement that they understand these business policies, that they will follow your policies, and that they understand the penalties for not following your policies. (You will need clearly spelled-out penalties for violation of business policies.) Set up and teach “rules of behavior” which describe how to handle and protect customer data and other business data. This may include not taking business data home or rules about doing business work on home computers. Having your employees trained in the fundamentals of information, system, and network security is one of the most effective investments you can make to better secure your business information, systems, and networks. You want to develop a “culture of security” in your employees and in your business. Typical providers of such security training could be your local Small Business Development Center (SBDC), community college, technical college, or commercial training vendors. Use good business practices to protect your information. Do not provide access to all data to any employee. Do not provide access to all systems (financial, personnel, inventory, manufacturing, etc) to any employee. For all employees, provide access to only those systems and only to the specific information that they need to do their jobs. Do not allow a single individual to both initiate and approve a transaction (financial or otherwise). The unfortunate truth is that insiders – those who work in a business – are the source of most security incidents in the business. The reason is that they already are inside, they are already trusted, and they have already been given access to important business information and systems. So, when they perform harmful actions (deliberately or otherwise), business information, systems, and networks suffer harm. (and, the business itself suffers harm). For business or personal email, do not open email attachments unless you are expecting the email with the attachment and you trust the sender. One of the most common means of distributing spyware or malicious code is via email attachments. Usually these threats are attached to emails that pretend to be from someone you know, but the “from” address has been altered and it only appears to be a legitimate message from a person you know. It is always a good idea to call the individual who “sent” the email and ask them if they sent it and ask them what the attachment is about. Sometimes, a person’s computer is compromised and malicious code becomes installed on it. Then, the malicious code uses the computer to send emails in the name of the owner of the computer to everyone in the computer owner’s email address book. The emails appear to be from the person, but instead are sent by the computer when activated by the malicious code. Those emails typically have copies of the malicious code (with a deceptive file name) as attachments to the email and will attempt to install the malicious code on the computer of anyone who receives the email and opens the attachment. Beware of emails which ask for sensitive personal or financial information – regardless of who the email appears to be from. No responsible business will ask for sensitive information in an email.  For business or personal email, do not click on links in email messages. Some scams are in the form of embedded links in emails. Once a recipient clicks on the link, malicious software (for example, viruses or key stroke logging software) is installed on the user’s computer. It is not a good idea to click on links in a Facebook or other social media page. Don’t do it unless you know what the web link connects to and you trust the person who sent the email to you. It is a good idea to call the individual prior to clicking on a link and ask if they sent the email and what the link is for. Always hold the mouse pointer over the link and look at the bottom of the browser window to ensure that the actual link (displayed there) matches the link description in the message. (the mouse pointer changes from an arrow to a tiny hand when placed over an active link)  For years, government officials and industry executives have run elaborate simulations of a targeted cyberattack on the power grid or gas pipelines in the United States, imagining how the country would respond. But when the real, this-is-not-a-drill moment arrived, it didn’t look anything like the war games. The attacker was not a terror group or a hostile state like Russia, China or Iran, as had been assumed in the simulations. It was a criminal extortion ring. The goal was not to disrupt the economy by taking a pipeline offline but to hold corporate data for ransom. The most visible effects — long lines of nervous motorists at gas stations — stemmed not from a government response but from a decision by the victim, Colonial Pipeline, which controls nearly half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel flowing along the East Coast, to turn off the spigot. It did so out of concern that the malware that had infected its back-office functions could make it difficult to bill for fuel delivered along the pipeline or even spread into the pipeline’s operating system. What happened next was a vivid example of the difference between tabletop simulations and the cascade of consequences that can follow even a relatively unsophisticated attack. The aftereffects of the episode are still playing out, but some of the lessons are already clear, and demonstrate how far the government and private industry have to go in preventing and dealing with cyberattacks and in creating rapid backup systems for when critical infrastructure goes down. In this case, the long-held belief that the pipeline’s operations were totally isolated from the data systems that were locked up by DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to be operating out of Russia, turned out to be false. And the company’s decision to turn off the pipeline touched off a series of dominoes including panic buying at the pumps and a quiet fear inside the government that the damage could spread quickly. A confidential assessment prepared by the Energy and Homeland Security Departments found that the country could only afford another three to five days with the Colonial pipeline shut down before buses and other mass transit would have to limit operations because of a lack of diesel fuel. Chemical factories and refinery operations would also shut down because there would be no way to distribute what they produced, the report said. And while President Biden’s aides announced efforts to find alternative ways to haul gasoline and jet fuel up the East Coast, none were immediately in place. There was a shortage of truck drivers, and of tanker cars for trains. “Every fragility was exposed,” Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, and now chairman of the think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator. “We learned a lot about what could go wrong. Unfortunately, so did our adversaries.” The list of lessons is long. Colonial, a private company, may have thought it had an impermeable wall of protections, but it was easily breached. Even after it paid the extortionists nearly $5 million in digital currency to recover its data, the company found that the process of decrypting its data and turning the pipeline back on again was agonizingly slow, meaning it will still be days before the East Coast gets back to normal. Editors’ Picks An Electrifying View of the Heart of the Milky Way Is It OK That I’m OK With Our Mom’s Adultery? A Town That Saved a Mountain, and a Mountain That Saved a Town “This is not like flicking on a light switch,” Mr. Biden said Thursday, noting that the 5,500-mile pipeline had never before been shut down. For the administration, the event proved a perilous week in crisis management. Mr. Biden told aides, one recalled, that nothing could wreak political damage faster than television images of gas lines and rising prices, with the inevitable comparison to Jimmy Carter’s worse moments as president. Mr. Biden feared that, unless the pipeline resumed operations, panic receded and price gouging was nipped in the bud, the situation would feed concerns that the economic recovery is still fragile and that inflation is rising. Beyond the flurry of actions to get oil moving on trucks, trains and ships, Mr. Biden published a long-gestating executive order that, for the first time, seeks to mandate changes in cybersecurity. And he suggested that he was willing to take steps that the Obama administration hesitated to take during the 2016 election hacks — direct action to strike back at the attackers. “We’re also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate,” Mr. Biden said, a line that seemed to hint that United States Cyber Command, the military’s cyberwarfare force, was being authorized to kick DarkSide off line, much as it did to another ransomware group in the fall ahead of the presidential election. Hours later, the group’s internet sites went dark. By early Friday, DarkSide, and several other ransomware groups, including Babuk, which has hacked Washington D.C.’s police department, announced they were getting out of the game. DarkSide alluded to disruptive action by an unspecified law enforcement agency, though it was not clear if that was the result of U.S. action or pressure from Russia ahead of Mr. Biden’s expected summit with President Vladimir V. Putin. And going quiet might simply have reflected a decision by the ransomware gang to frustrate retaliation efforts by shutting down its operations, perhaps temporarily. The Pentagon’s Cyber Command referred questions to the National Security Council, which declined to comment. The episode underscored the emergence of a new “blended threat,” one that may come from cybercriminals, but is often tolerated, and sometimes encouraged, by a nation that sees the attacks as serving its interests.That is why Mr. Biden singled out Russia — not as the culprit, but as the nation that harbors more ransomware groups than any other country. “We do not believe the Russian government was involved in this attack, but we do have strong reason to believe the criminals who did this attack are living in Russia,” Mr. Biden said. “We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take action against these ransomware networks.” With DarkSide’s systems down, it is unclear how Mr. Biden’s administration would retaliate further, beyond possible indictments and sanctions, which have not deterred Russian cybercriminals before. Striking back with a cyberattack also carries its own risks of escalation. The administration also has to reckon with the fact that so much of America’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and remains ripe for attack. “This attack has exposed just how poor our resilience is,” said Kiersten E. Todt, the managing director of the nonprofit Cyber Readiness Institute. “We are overthinking the threat, when we’re still not doing the bare basics to secure our critical infrastructure.” The good news, some officials said, was that Americans got a wake-up call. Congress came face-to-face with the reality that the federal government lacks the authority to require the companies that control more than 80 percent of the nation’s critical infrastructure adopt minimal levels of cybersecurity. The bad news, they said, was that American adversaries — not only superpowers but terrorists and cybercriminals — learned just how little it takes to incite chaos across a large part of the country, even if they do not break into the core of the electric grid, or the operational control systems that move gasoline, water and propane around the country. Something as basic as a well-designed ransomware attack may easily do the trick, while offering plausible deniability to states like Russia, China and Iran that often tap outsiders for sensitive cyberoperations. It remains a mystery how DarkSide first broke into Colonial’s business network. The privately held company has said virtually nothing about how the attack unfolded, at least in public. It waited four days before having any substantive discussions with the administration, an eternity during a cyberattack. Cybersecurity experts also note that Colonial Pipeline would never have had to shut down its pipeline if it had more confidence in the separation between its business network and pipeline operations. “There should absolutely be separation between data management and the actual operational technology,” Ms. Todt said. “Not doing the basics is frankly inexcusable for a company that carries 45 percent of gas to the East Coast.” Other pipeline operators in the United States deploy advanced firewalls between their data and their operations that only allow data to flow one direction, out of the pipeline, and would prevent a ransomware attack from spreading in. Colonial Pipeline has not said whether it deployed that level of security on its pipeline. Industry analysts say many critical infrastructure operators say installing such unidirectional gateways along a 5,500-mile pipeline can be complicated or prohibitively expensive. Others say the cost to deploy those safeguards are still cheaper than the losses from potential downtime. Deterring ransomware criminals, which have been growing in number and brazenness over the past few years, will certainly be more difficult than deterring nations. But this week made the urgency clear. “It’s all fun and games when we are stealing each other’s money,” said Sue Gordon, a former principal deputy director of national intelligence, and a longtime C.I.A. analyst with a specialty in cyberissues, said at a conference held by The Cipher Brief, an online intelligence newsletter. “When we are messing with a society’s ability to operate, we can’t tolerate it.” The US believes that Russia\\'s domestic intelligence agency has arrested the hacker responsible for the May ransomware attack that forced a major US fuel pipeline to shut down for days, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Friday. It appears to mark a rare instance of US-Russian cooperation against a major cybercrime group, following direct appeals from President Joe Biden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The cyberattack against Colonial Pipeline in May prompted the company to preemptively shut down its fuel distribution operations, leading to widespread shortages at gas stations along the East Coast. The official spoke to reporters after Russia\\'s FSB intelligence agency said Friday that, at the behest of US authorities, it had detained multiple people associated with REvil, a type of ransomware that has cost US firms millions of dollars. The US and Russia do not have an extradition treaty. While Russian authorities said those apprehended would be prosecuted, the extent to which that will happen is unclear. The FSB said Russian authorities had seized millions of dollars, raided the homes of 14 people and detained an unspecified number of people connected with the so-called REvil ransomware. REvil was used in damaging hacks on a top US meat supplier in May and US software provider Kaseya in July, with the latter infecting up to 1,500 businesses around the world, US officials have previously said. The FSB\\'s announcement follows a week of talks among the US, its European allies and Russia that failed to reach a breakthrough over the tens of thousands of troops Russia has amassed near Ukraine\\'s border. \"In our mind, this is not related to what\\'s happening with Russia and Ukraine,\" the senior administration official said. But some cybersecurity analysts pointed to the timing of the FSB announcement, which comes as the US has threatened severe sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine. \"This is Russian ransomware diplomacy,\" Dmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert who is chairman of the non-profit Silverado Policy Accelerator, told CNN. \"It is a signal to the United States: If you don\\'t enact severe sanctions against us for invasion of Ukraine, we will continue to cooperate with you on ransomware investigations.\" Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) arrested a hacker believed to be responsible for a May cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, a fuel pipeline running from Texas to New York, the Biden administration confirmed Friday.The FSB raided the homes of 14 people, seized millions of dollars and detained an unspecified number of people connected to REvil, a Russia-based ransomware operation, CNN reported. Russian authorities said that the people apprehended in the raids would be prosecuted, CNN reported. The arrests came after months of talks between the Biden Administration and Russian officials, and were the result of what the FSB called “the appeal of competent U.S. authorities,” Politico reported. Ransomware attacks have become an increasingly urgent problem for businesses, with up to 1,500 around the world targeted by the REvil ransomware group alone, CNN reported. On May 7, the Colonial Pipeline was shut down to contain the effects of a ransomware attack by a hacker group calling itself DarkSide. Colonial Pipeline paid the hackers about $4.4 million in bitcoin, of which about $2.3 million was recovered by Justice Department officials in June. The pipeline resumed operations May 12, at which point 11 states were suffering  significant fuel shortages. North Caroline was hardest-hit, with 65% of gas stations in the state reporting they had no fuel on the day the pipeline restarted. On May 14, DarkSide announced that its servers had been seized by law enforcement and that the group would disband. The president and CEO of the Colonial Pipeline Co. gave a public account of the initial hours after a ransomware attack on his company May 7. Joseph Blount Jr. told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee the company learned of the attack shortly before 5 a.m., and within an hour had made the decision to shut down the entire pipeline. Blount also revealed that the company paid the ransom only one day after learning of the attack. Colonial Pipeline’s CEO told a Senate committee on Tuesday the company paid the $5 million ransom one day after Russian-based cybercriminals hacked its IT network, crippling fuel deliveries up and down the East Coast. Joseph Blount Jr. told members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in prepared remarks that the company learned of the attack shortly before 5 a.m. on May 7, when an employee discovered a ransom note on a system in the IT network. The note said hackers had “exfiltrated” material from the company’s shared internal drive, and it demanded approximately $5 million in exchange for the files. The company was attacked by a ransomware program created by DarkSide, a cyber criminal group believed to operate out of Russia. Blount said that shortly after discovering the ransom note, the employee notified a supervisor and the decision was made to immediately shut down the entire pipeline. “At approximately 5:55 A.M. employees began the shutdown process,” Blount wrote. “By 6:10 A.M., they confirmed that all 5,500 miles of pipelines had been shut down.” The decision to shut down the entire pipeline was driven by “the imperative to isolate and contain the attack to help ensure the malware did not spread to the Operational Technology network, which controls our pipeline operations, if it had not already.” The shutdown caused major disruptions to gas delivery up and down the East Coast, as trucks struggled to restock gas stations, and long lines developed at pumps, especially in the Southeast. Airline operations also were disrupted. Blount’s testimony revealed just how quickly the company decided to suspend operations, and it provided new details about the first few days after the attack. The company believes attackers “exploited a legacy virtual private network profile that was not intended to be in use,” Blount told senators. But he admitted that the account was not protected by multifactor authentication, which is currently the company standard in most of its operations. Blount said the password was complicated, though. “It was not a ‘Colonial 123’-type password.” Blount also testified about the approximately $5 million in ransom that the company paid to the DarkSide hackers. He revealed that Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom one day after the attack. “I made the decision that Colonial Pipeline would pay the ransom to have every tool available to us to swiftly get the pipeline back up and running,” Blount said in his opening statement. “It was one of the toughest decisions I have had to make in my life.” “At the time, I kept this information close hold because we were concerned about operational security and minimizing publicity for the threat actor,” he said. In response to a question about whether the company paid ransom to an entity under U.S. sanctions, Blount said the company checked the sanctions list maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset Control before making the payment. The day before Blount testified, U.S. law enforcement officials announced that they were able to recover $2.3 million in bitcoin from the hacker group. Blount also told senators that the company contacted the FBI within hours of discovering the attack. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has managed to recover part of the ransom paid to the criminal hacking group believed to be responsible for the attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which disrupted a major supply of fuel to the East Coast for roughly a week in May. Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco announced on June 7 that the DOJ, through its new Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, was able to recover about 64 of the 75 bitcoins paid to the attackers by “following the money” — even though the money was in difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency. Once it knew the address of the hackers’ wallet, it was able to get a court order to seize the funds in it. The FBI apparently had the digital key needed to open the wallet. How it got that access has not been made public. The seizure is a rare example of ransomware payments being recovered. The attack has been attributed to DarkSide, a criminal hacker group based in Eastern Europe. The pipeline, which supplies about half of the East Coast’s gasoline, went down for several days, causing gas panic-buying, shortages, and price spikes in some states. It appears to be the largest ever cyberattack on an American energy system and yet another example of cybersecurity vulnerabilities that President Joe Biden has promised to address. The Colonial Pipeline Company reported on May 7 that it was the victim of a “cybersecurity attack” that “involves ransomware,” forcing the company to take some systems offline and disabling the pipeline. The Georgia-based company says it operates the largest petroleum pipeline in the United States, carrying 2.5 million barrels a day of gasoline, diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel on its 5,500-mile route from Texas to New Jersey. The pipeline provides nearly half of the East Coast’s fuel supply, and a prolonged shutdown would have caused price increases and shortages to ripple across the industry. This was largely averted when the pipeline came back online within the week, but price increases and shortages happened anyway, largely due to panic rather than supply. Five days after the hack was announced, the national average price for a gallon of regular gas had pushed past $3 for the first time since 2014 (though gas prices were already on an upswing before the pipeline shutdown), with bigger jumps in some states the pipeline serves, including Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp temporarily suspended the state’s gas tax to compensate for the increased prices. Other states put price gouging laws into effect. “It’s more likely that fuel shortages will be a result of panic buying from consumers watching the headlines unfold, as opposed to shortages directly caused by the attack,” Marty Edwards, former director of industrial control systems for CISA, and vice president of operational technology security for Tenable, told Recode. “This is something we saw with Covid and grocery stores selling out of household items. Regardless, it shows the impact cybersecurity has on our everyday lives.” “It’s much easier to understand the impact of a cyberattack if it directly impacts your day-to-day life,” he added. The FBI confirmed DarkSide is responsible for the attacks. DarkSide does not appear to be linked to any nation-states, saying in a statement that “our goal is to make money [not to create] problems for society” and that it is apolitical. DarkSide claimed it was shutting down in the wake of the pipeline attack. According to cybersecurity company Check Point, however, DarkSide supplies its ransomware services to its partners. “This means we know very little on the real threat actor behind the attack on Colonial, who can be any one of the partners of DarkSide,” Lotem Finkelstein, Check Point’s head of threat intelligence, told Recode. “What we do know is that to take down extensive operations like the Colonial Pipeline reveals a sophisticated and well-designed cyberattack.” Colonial acknowledged on May 19 that it did indeed pay $4.4 million worth of bitcoin (which is now worth considerably less — even though the DOJ was able to recover 64 bitcoins, they’re only worth $2.3 million now). CEO Joseph Blount told the Wall Street Journal that paying the ransom was a difficult decision, but one that he felt was “the right thing to do for our country.” Blount added that it will cost Colonial far more — tens of millions of dollars — to completely restore its systems over the next several months. Ransomware attacks generally use malware to lock companies out of their own systems until a ransom is paid. They’ve surged in the past few years and cost billions of dollars in ransoms paid alone — not counting those that aren’t reported or any associated costs with having systems offline until the ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks have targeted everything from private businesses to the government to hospitals and health care systems. The latter are especially attractive targets, given how urgent it is to get their systems back up as soon as possible. Energy systems and suppliers have also been a target of ransomware and cyberattacks. The cybersecurity of America’s energy infrastructure has been a particular concern in recent years, with the Trump administration declaring a national emergency in May 2020 meant to secure America’s bulk power system with an executive order that would forbid the acquisition of equipment from countries that pose an “unacceptable risk to national security or the security and safety of American citizens.” Bloomberg reported about a month after the attack that the company was likely breached through a leaked password to an old account that had access to the virtual private network (VPN) used to remotely access the company’s servers. The account reportedly didn’t have multifactor authentication, so the hackers only needed to know the username and the password to gain access to the largest petroleum pipeline in the country. The attack underscores two of the Biden administration’s stated priorities: improving American infrastructure and cybersecurity. The large-scale Russian SolarWinds hack, disclosed in December 2020, was shown to have affected several federal government systems. Biden said then that, as president, “my administration will make cybersecurity a top priority at every level of government — and we will make dealing with this breach a top priority from the moment we take office. ... I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation.” Biden has also unveiled a $2 trillion infrastructure plan that includes $100 billion to modernize the electrical grid, which cybersecurity experts hoped would include improved cybersecurity measures. Biden also suspended the Trump bulk power system executive order to roll out his own plan. And Biden has signed an executive order meant to strengthen the federal government’s cybersecurity standards for software and technology services it uses, which a senior administration official described as a fundamental shift in the federal government’s approach to cybersecurity incidents — away from spot responses and toward trying to prevent them from happening in the first place. The order has been in the works since shortly after Biden took office, the official said. But these measures are more focused on preventing another SolarWinds-like attack. Federal officials told the New York Times they don’t think the order does enough to prevent a sophisticated attack, nor would it apply to a privately held company like Colonial. The oil pipeline attack might strengthen demands for cybersecurity standards for companies that play an important role in Americans’ lives. As it stands, it’s often left up to them which security measures they use to protect critical systems. “Ransomware is about extortion, and extortion is about pressure,” James Shank, chief architect of community services at cybersecurity company Team Cymru, told Recode. “Impacting fuel distribution gets peoples’ attention right away. ... This emphasizes the need for a coordinated effort that bridges public- and private-sector capabilities to protect our national interests.” The pipeline was able to get back up and running before a major or prolonged disruption to the fuel supply chain, and customers’ wallets weren’t hit too hard. But the next one — and many cybersecurity experts fear there will be a next one, or several next ones — could be a lot worse if measures aren’t taken at the highest levels to prevent it. “The shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline by cyber-criminals highlights a massive problem — many of the companies running our critical infrastructure have left their systems vulnerable to hackers through dangerously negligent cybersecurity,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said in a statement. “Congress must take action to hold critical infrastructure companies accountable and force them to secure their computer systems.”  F.B.I. Identifies Group Behind Pipeline Hack The attack by DarkSide, a relatively new criminal group believed to have roots in Eastern Europe, exposed the remarkable vulnerability of key American infrastructure. A deputy national security adviser said that the government believed DarkSide was “a criminal actor” but was looking for any ties to nation-states.   Colonial Pipeline storage tanks in Woodbridge, N.J. David E. SangerPranshu Verma By David E. Sanger and Pranshu Verma The F.B.I. confirmed on Monday that the hacking group DarkSide was responsible for the ransomware attack that closed a U.S. pipeline providing the East Coast with nearly half of its gasoline and jet fuel. The Biden administration is expected to announce an executive order in the coming days to strengthen America’s cyberdefense infrastructure. President Biden said on Monday that the government had mitigated any impact the hack on the petroleum pipeline might have had on the U.S. fuel supply. He added that his administration had efforts underway to “disrupt and prosecute ransomware criminals.” Colonial Pipeline, the operator of the system, issued a statement saying that restoring service “takes time.” It added that while the situation was “fluid and continues to evolve,” the company would restore service incrementally, with the goal of “substantially” resuming service by the end of the week. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, said Monday afternoon that the government believed DarkSide was “a criminal actor” but was looking for any ties the group might have to nation-states. She added that Colonial had not sought cyber support from the government, and said that she could not confirm if the company, a private corporation, had paid any ransom. Mr. Biden also said on Monday that, so far, there was no evidence from U.S. intelligence officials that Russia was involved, but he added: “There is evidence that the actors’ ransomware is in Russia. They have some responsibility to deal with this.” Colonial’s pipeline transports 2.5 million barrels each day, taking refined gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel from the Gulf Coast up to New York Harbor and New York’s major airports. Most of that goes into large storage tanks, and with energy use depressed by the coronavirus pandemic, the attack was unlikely to cause any immediate disruptions. Late Friday, Colonial said in a vaguely worded statement that it had shut down its 5,500 miles of pipeline, which it said carried 45 percent of the East Coast’s fuel supplies, in an effort to contain the breach. Earlier in the day, there had been disruptions along the pipeline, but it was not clear at the time whether that was a direct result of the attack or of the company’s moves to proactively halt it.

For years, government officials and industry executives have run elaborate simulations of a targeted cyberattack on the power grid or gas pipelines in the United States, imagining how the country would respond. But when the real, this-is-not-a-drill moment arrived, it didn’t look anything like the war games. The attacker was not a terror group or a hostile state like Russia, China or Iran, as had been assumed in the simulations. It was a criminal extortion ring. The goal was not to disrupt the economy by taking a pipeline offline but to hold corporate data for ransom. The most visible effects — long lines of nervous motorists at gas stations — stemmed not from a government response but from a decision by the victim, Colonial Pipeline, which controls nearly half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel flowing along the East Coast, to turn off the spigot. It did so out of concern that the malware that had infected its back-office functions could make it difficult to bill for fuel delivered along the pipeline or even spread into the pipeline’s operating system. What happened next was a vivid example of the difference between tabletop simulations and the cascade of consequences that can follow even a relatively unsophisticated attack. The aftereffects of the episode are still playing out, but some of the lessons are already clear, and demonstrate how far the government and private industry have to go in preventing and dealing with cyberattacks and in creating rapid backup systems for when critical infrastructure goes down. In this case, the long-held belief that the pipeline’s operations were totally isolated from the data systems that were locked up by DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to be operating out of Russia, turned out to be false. And the company’s decision to turn off the pipeline touched off a series of dominoes including panic buying at the pumps and a quiet fear inside the government that the damage could spread quickly. A confidential assessment prepared by the Energy and Homeland Security Departments found that the country could only afford another three to five days with the Colonial pipeline shut down before buses and other mass transit would have to limit operations because of a lack of diesel fuel. Chemical factories and refinery operations would also shut down because there would be no way to distribute what they produced, the report said. And while President Biden’s aides announced efforts to find alternative ways to haul gasoline and jet fuel up the East Coast, none were immediately in place. There was a shortage of truck drivers, and of tanker cars for trains. “Every fragility was exposed,” Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, and now chairman of the think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator. “We learned a lot about what could go wrong. Unfortunately, so did our adversaries.” The list of lessons is long. Colonial, a private company, may have thought it had an impermeable wall of protections, but it was easily breached. Even after it paid the extortionists nearly $5 million in digital currency to recover its data, the company found that the process of decrypting its data and turning the pipeline back on again was agonizingly slow, meaning it will still be days before the East Coast gets back to normal. Editors’ Picks A Beginner’s Thanksgiving: 7 Recipes That Lighten the Workload One Chaste Marriage, Four Kids, and the Catholic Church Up, Up and Away: The Trippy Tales Behind ‘Flying Over Sunset’ “This is not like flicking on a light switch,” Mr. Biden said Thursday, noting that the 5,500-mile pipeline had never before been shut down. For the administration, the event proved a perilous week in crisis management. Mr. Biden told aides, one recalled, that nothing could wreak political damage faster than television images of gas lines and rising prices, with the inevitable comparison to Jimmy Carter’s worse moments as president. Mr. Biden feared that, unless the pipeline resumed operations, panic receded and price gouging was nipped in the bud, the situation would feed concerns that the economic recovery is still fragile and that inflation is rising. Beyond the flurry of actions to get oil moving on trucks, trains and ships, Mr. Biden published a long-gestating executive order that, for the first time, seeks to mandate changes in cybersecurity. And he suggested that he was willing to take steps that the Obama administration hesitated to take during the 2016 election hacks — direct action to strike back at the attackers. “We’re also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate,” Mr. Biden said, a line that seemed to hint that United States Cyber Command, the military’s cyberwarfare force, was being authorized to kick DarkSide off line, much as it did to another ransomware group in the fall ahead of the presidential election.

Hours later, the group’s internet sites went dark. By early Friday, DarkSide, and several other ransomware groups, including Babuk, which has hacked Washington D.C.’s police department, announced they were getting out of the game. DarkSide alluded to disruptive action by an unspecified law enforcement agency, though it was not clear if that was the result of U.S. action or pressure from Russia ahead of Mr. Biden’s expected summit with President Vladimir V. Putin. And going quiet might simply have reflected a decision by the ransomware gang to frustrate retaliation efforts by shutting down its operations, perhaps temporarily. The Pentagon’s Cyber Command referred questions to the National Security Council, which declined to comment. The episode underscored the emergence of a new “blended threat,” one that may come from cybercriminals, but is often tolerated, and sometimes encouraged, by a nation that sees the attacks as serving its interests.That is why Mr. Biden singled out Russia — not as the culprit, but as the nation that harbors more ransomware groups than any other country.  Image President Biden made clear that he was willing to take action to disrupt or shut down the criminal network behind the extortion. President Biden made clear that he was willing to take action to disrupt or shut down the criminal network behind the extortion.Credit...T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times “We do not believe the Russian government was involved in this attack, but we do have strong reason to believe the criminals who did this attack are living in Russia,” Mr. Biden said. “We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take action against these ransomware networks.” With DarkSide’s systems down, it is unclear how Mr. Biden’s administration would retaliate further, beyond possible indictments and sanctions, which have not deterred Russian cybercriminals before. Striking back with a cyberattack also carries its own risks of escalation. The administration also has to reckon with the fact that so much of America’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and remains ripe for attack. “This attack has exposed just how poor our resilience is,” said Kiersten E. Todt, the managing director of the nonprofit Cyber Readiness Institute. “We are overthinking the threat, when we’re still not doing the bare basics to secure our critical infrastructure.” The good news, some officials said, was that Americans got a wake-up call. Congress came face-to-face with the reality that the federal government lacks the authority to require the companies that control more than 80 percent of the nation’s critical infrastructure adopt minimal levels of cybersecurity. The bad news, they said, was that American adversaries — not only superpowers but terrorists and cybercriminals — learned just how little it takes to incite chaos across a large part of the country, even if they do not break into the core of the electric grid, or the operational control systems that move gasoline, water and propane around the country. Something as basic as a well-designed ransomware attack may easily do the trick, while offering plausible deniability to states like Russia, China and Iran that often tap outsiders for sensitive cyberoperations. It remains a mystery how DarkSide first broke into Colonial’s business network. The privately held company has said virtually nothing about how the attack unfolded, at least in public. It waited four days before having any substantive discussions with the administration, an eternity during a cyberattack. Cybersecurity experts also note that Colonial Pipeline would never have had to shut down its pipeline if it had more confidence in the separation between its business network and pipeline operations. “There should absolutely be separation between data management and the actual operational technology,” Ms. Todt said. “Not doing the basics is frankly inexcusable for a company that carries 45 percent of gas to the East Coast.” Other pipeline operators in the United States deploy advanced firewalls between their data and their operations that only allow data to flow one direction, out of the pipeline, and would prevent a ransomware attack from spreading in. Colonial Pipeline has not said whether it deployed that level of security on its pipeline. Industry analysts say many critical infrastructure operators say installing such unidirectional gateways along a 5,500-mile pipeline can be complicated or prohibitively expensive. Others say the cost to deploy those safeguards are still cheaper than the losses from potential downtime. Deterring ransomware criminals, which have been growing in number and brazenness over the past few years, will certainly be more difficult than deterring nations. But this week made the urgency clear. “It’s all fun and games when we are stealing each other’s money,” said Sue Gordon, a former principal deputy director of national intelligence, and a longtime C.I.A. analyst with a specialty in cyberissues, said at a conference held by The Cipher Brief, an online intelligence newsletter. “When we are messing with a society’s ability to operate, we can’t tolerate it.” Retail giant Target agreed this week to pay $18.5 million to settle claims by 47 states and the District of Columbia and resolve a multi-state investigation into a massive data breach in late 2013. The investigation — led by the Attorneys General of Connecticut and Illinois — found that cyber attackers had accessed Target\\'s gateway server through credentials stolen from a third-party vendor, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement on Tuesday. In one of the biggest data breaches to hit a U.S. retailer, Target had reported that hackers stole data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who had visited its stores during the 2013 holiday season. California will receive more than $1.4 million from the settlement, the largest share of any state, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. The costs associated with the settlement are already reflected in the data breach liability reserves that Target has previously recognized and disclosed, the company said in a statement. Target also said the total cost of the data breach had been $202 million. Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck said the company has so far settled with financial institutions and states but is yet to finalize a consumer settlement. \"There is a class action settlement that is outstanding. We have reached an agreement but it hasn\\'t been legally finalized yet.\" As part of the settlement announced on Tuesday, Target is required to adopt advanced measures to secure customer information such as employing an executive to oversee a comprehensive information security program as well as advise its chief executive and board. The company is also required to hire a independent, qualified third party to conduct a comprehensive security assessment and encrypt or otherwise protect card information to make it useless if stolen. Target was warned from its internal security system about last year\\'s massive breach before the data was stolen, but failed to act, according to a new report from Bloomberg Businessweek. The report says that a recently installed digital security system called FireEye flagged the malware uploaded by hackers as a high-priority problem on Nov. 30 — after Target\\'s main system had been infected, but before the data had been passed on to the hackers themselves. To be fair, FireEye may not have been known and trusted at that point, having only started widely rolling out last May. But if the new report is true, the negligence could be very damning for the retailer. The massive security breach at Target that some are calling the biggest in history is slowly emerging from the mystery with which the company has been careful to shroud it. Security blogs are piecing together a picture of the hackers and the software they used to swipe data from tens of millions of customers — but much is still unknown. According to information posted by Brian Krebs, the security expert who broke the story of the breach to begin with, the attack appears to have been done with malware for sale on a forum frequented by hackers. This software sits inside the point of service (POS) device and logs every credit card going through. It\\'s not an uncommon type of attack, but the scale is unprecedented. Krebs cites sources \"close to the Target investigation\" as saying that the hackers compromised the security of a Target web server, then somehow parlayed that breach into access to the company\\'s internal network — from which they could distribute the malware to all vulnerable POS devices. Further research by Seculert puts dates on when machines were first infected, and CrowdStrike uncovered records indicating someone at Target noticed the malware as early as Dec. 11. An aging, Windows XP Embedded-based POS operating system with insufficient virus detection capabilities may be at fault, but the malware, a variant of a known bit of card-skimming software called BlackPOS, appears to have been carefully modified to avoid detection by existing security software. The hackers then had a network of compromised POS units logging credit cards all day, and could retrieve that data from the Target internal network whenever it was convenient to them. In a scan of Target\\'s systems uploaded to (and subsequently removed from) security site ThreatExpert.com, the hackers\\' login name and password (\"Best1_user\" and \"BackupU$r\") can even be seen. Target may not be sharing the rest of the details publicly, but they are cooperating with the U.S. government, which according to a Reuters report sent out a 16-page document Thursday to other retailers describing the techniques used in the breach. And who are these masked men? Security Affairs got hold of a video demonstrating how to operate the malware in question — no doubt intended for users. But the hacker hosting it briefly and irresponsibly reveals a webpage in the background showing what is presumed to be his profile on VKontacte, Russia\\'s biggest social network. This surprising lapse of operational security has led to the identification of, if not the hackers themselves, then at least their nationalities and some pseudonyms under which they are operating. They appear to be Russian and Ukranian, and the leader goes by the name \"Wagner Richard\" — though that may only be a clue that he enjoys the opera. More details will surely come to light when the government\\'s memo leaks (as such documents often do) and when more forensic analysis has been done on the software used in the hack. Target is also scheduled to testify before Congress in the near future. If you think you might have been affected, there are a few simple steps you can take to minimize your risk — and since the full extent of the breach is not yet known, it might be best to be proactive.Feb. 26, 2014 — -- Target Corp. today revealed the staggering cost of a security breach that exposed personal information of millions of its customers. The hit to Target\\'s profits points up the high stakes facing businesses when it comes to protecting customer card data from hackers. Target (NYSE: TGT) said the cost of the breach to date has been $61 million, offset by $44 million in insurance payouts. But the department store chain said it doesn\\'t know what the future cost of the breach will be. Target stock rose more than 7 percent as of mid-day Wednesday to about $60.69 a share, possibly on investor relief that the costs weren\\'t even higher. Since the company announced the breach of as many as 40 million customer credit card accounts in mid-December, Target stock has fallen about 10 percent. The company\\'s breach-related security costs included offers of free credit-monitoring to customers, investigation expenses, increased staffing in call centers, fraud losses, card replacement costs, and more. Target has a $100 million plan to use of chip-enabled technology by early 2015 in all its stores. Card issuers have been slow to implement chip technology embedded in cards used in other parts of the world, including Europe. Credit card fraud is estimated to cost $12 billion a year. It\\'s not clear how much it would cost to update the nation\\'s credit card readers to accept chip-embedded cards. Partly because of the fraud costs, Target said its fourth-quarter profit was down 46 percent while revenue fell 5.3 percent. Read More: Data-Breach Costs Take Toll on Target Profit Ken Perkins, an analyst with Morningstar, said Target\\'s fourth-quarter financial results were actually better than he expected. \"Going forward, there are a lot of indications that Target\\'s long-term business potential is still intact, despite near-term challenges they have to overcome,\" he said. While the company is closing eight stores in the U.S. by May, and experiences \"stiff competition\" in Canada, Perkins said he believes profitability will improve across the border and inventory markdowns will slow. Dec. 19, 2013— -- Target says information from approximately 40 million of its customer credit and debit cards swiped in stores may have been compromised by a data breach during the height of the holiday shopping season. The data breach occurred between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, 2013, at U.S. stores, Target said in a statement this morning. Target said it immediately contacted authorities and financial institutions once it became aware of the breach. The Minneapolis based-company said it was teaming with a third-party forensics firm to investigate the breach. \"Target\\'s first priority is preserving the trust of our guests, and we have moved swiftly to address this issue, so guests can shop with confidence. We regret any inconvenience this may cause,\" said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"We take this matter very seriously and are working with law enforcement to bring those responsible to justice.\" The U.S. Secret Service is investigating but declined to provide further details. Brian Krebs, who first broke the story for KrebsOnSecurity.com Wednesday, said the breach couldn\\'t have come at a worse time for shoppers and Target. \"I can\\'t think of another day in the calendar when target or anyone else could expect to have more people in stores. More deals, traffic, more swipes -- perfect day to launch an attack,\" Krebs told ABC News. Krebs said the breach involved the data stored on the magnetic strip of cards used only in stores and not online. The breach, said Krebs, may extend to nearly all of the 1,797 Target stores nationwide. \"The information that\\'s stored on the magnetic strip -- name, card number, expiration date, other info -- if bad guys can steal that card ... they can actually create a second copy,\" Krebs said. If thieves can create a second copy and were able to intercept a PIN number, that could allow them to withdraw money from ATMs, said Krebs. Customers who may have been affected should pay extra attention to their debit and credit card statements, said Krebs. \"Advice to customers -- be vigilant, pay attention to your statement if something doesn\\'t look right,\" Krebs cautioned. \"Whether or not you feel like you might be impacted by this breach, it\\'s a really good idea, particularly around this time of year, to pay attention to what\\'s on your debit and credit card statements.\" While consumers will likely be reimbursed for any fraudulent charges, the refund might not come until after Christmas, creating another headache for shoppers.  Cybersecurity Hackers Breached Colonial Pipeline Using Compromised Password By William Turton and Kartikay Mehrotra The hack that took down the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S. and led to shortages across the East Coast was the result of a single compromised password, according to a cybersecurity consultant who responded to the attack. Hackers gained entry into the networks of Colonial Pipeline Co. on April 29 through a virtual private network account, which allowed employees to remotely access the company’s computer network, said Charles Carmakal, senior vice president at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, part of FireEye Inc., in an interview. The account was no longer in use at the time of the attack but could still be used to access Colonial’s network, he said. The account’s password has since been discovered inside a batch of leaked passwords on the dark web. That means a Colonial employee may have used the same password on another account that was previously hacked, he said. However, Carmakal said he isn’t certain that’s how hackers obtained the password, and he said investigators may never know for certain how the credential was obtained. Colonial Pipeline Storage Tanks As Gas Pumps Run Dry Storage tanks at a Colonial Pipeline Inc. facility in Avenel, New JerseyPhotographer: Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg The VPN account, which has since been deactivated, didn’t use multifactor authentication, a basic cybersecurity tool, allowing the hackers to breach Colonial’s network using just a compromised username and password. It’s not known how the hackers obtained the correct username or if they were able to determine it on their own. “We did a pretty exhaustive search of the environment to try and determine how they actually got those credentials,” Carmakal said. “We don’t see any evidence of phishing for the employee whose credentials were used. We have not seen any other evidence of attacker activity before April 29.” Ransom Note A little more than one week later, on May 7, an employee in Colonial’s control room saw a ransom note demanding cryptocurrency appear on a computer just before 5 a.m. The employee notified an operations supervisor who immediately began to start the process of shutting down the pipeline, Colonial Chief Executive Officer Joseph Blount said in an interview. By 6:10 a.m., the entire pipeline had been shut down, Blount said. It was the first time Colonial had shut down the entirety of its gasoline pipeline system in its 57-year history, Blount said. “We had no choice at that point,” he said. “It was absolutely the right thing to do. At that time, we had no idea who was attacking us or what their motives were.” Colonial Pipeline made Carmakal and Blount available for an interview in advance of Blount’s testimony next week before Congressional committees, in which he’s expected to provide further detail regarding the scope of the compromise and address the company’s decision to pay ransom to the attackers. It didn’t take long for news of Colonial’s shutdown to spread. The company’s system transports roughly 2.5 million barrels of fuel daily from the Gulf Coast to the Eastern Seaboard. The outage led to long lines at gas stations, many of which ran out, and higher fuel prices. Colonial began resuming service on May 12. Soon after the attack, Colonial embarked on an exhaustive examination of the pipeline, tracking 29,000 miles on the ground and through the air to look for visible damage. The company ultimately determined the pipeline wasn’t damaged. Sweeping Network In the meantime, Mandiant was sweeping the network to understand how far hackers had probed while installing new detection tools that would alert Colonial of any follow-on attacks -- which aren’t uncommon after a substantial breach, Carmakal said. Investigators haven’t found any evidence the same group of hackers tried to regain access. “The last thing we wanted was for a threat actor to have active access to a network where there is any possible risk to a pipeline. That was the biggest focus until it was turned back on,” Carmakal said. n, I agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and to receive offers and promotions from Bloomberg. Mandiant also traced the hackers’ movements in the network to determine how close they got to compromising systems adjacent to Colonial’s operational technology network -- the system of computers that control the actual flow of gasoline. While the hackers did move around within the company’s information technology network, there wasn’t any indication they were able to breach the more critical operational technology systems, he said. It was only after Mandiant and Colonial were able to conclusively determine that the attack had been contained that they considered re-opening their pipeline, said Blount. Colonial paid the hackers, who were an affiliate of a Russia-linked cybercrime group known as DarkSide, a $4.4 million ransom shortly after the hack. The hackers also stole nearly 100 gigabytes of data from Colonial Pipeline and threatened to leak it if the ransom wasn’t paid, Bloomberg News reported last month. Colonial has hired Rob Lee, the founder and chief executive officer of the Dragos Inc., a cybersecurity firm that focuses on industrial control systems, and John Strand, owner and security analyst at Black Hills Information Security, to consult on its cyber defenses and to focus on warding off future attacks. In the wake of the attack on his company, Blount said he would like the U.S. government to go after hackers who have found safe haven in Russia. “Ultimately the government needs to focus on the actors themselves. As a private company, we don’t have a political capability of shutting down the host countries that have these bad actors in them.” Equifax, one of the three major consumer credit reporting agencies, said on Thursday that hackers had gained access to company data that potentially compromised sensitive information for 143 million American consumers, including Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. The attack on the company represents one of the largest risks to personally sensitive information in recent years, and is the third major cybersecurity threat for the agency since 2015. Equifax, based in Atlanta, is a particularly tempting target for hackers. If identity thieves wanted to hit one place to grab all the data needed to do the most damage, they would go straight to one of the three major credit reporting agencies. “This is about as bad as it gets,” said Pamela Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit research group. “If you have a credit report, chances are you may be in this breach. The chances are much better than 50 percent.” Criminals gained access to certain files in the company’s system from mid-May to July by exploiting a weak point in website software, according to an investigation by Equifax and security consultants. The company said that it discovered the intrusion on July 29 and has since found no evidence of unauthorized activity on its main consumer or commercial credit reporting databases. In addition to the other material, hackers were also able to retrieve names, birth dates and addresses. Credit card numbers for 209,000 consumers were stolen, while documents with personal information used in disputes for 182,000 people were also taken. Other cyberattacks, such as the two breaches that Yahoo announced in 2016, have eclipsed the penetration at Equifax in sheer size, but the Equifax attack is worse in terms of severity. Thieves were able to siphon far more personal information — the keys that unlock consumers’ medical histories, bank accounts and employee accounts. “On a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of risk to consumers, this is a 10,” said Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst at Gartner. An F.B.I. spokesperson said the agency was aware of the breach and was tracking the situation. Last year, identity thieves successfully made off with critical W-2 tax and salary data from an Equifax website. And earlier this year, thieves again stole W-2 tax data from an Equifax subsidiary, TALX, which provides online payroll, tax and human resources services to some of the nation’s largest corporations. Cybersecurity professionals criticized Equifax on Thursday for not improving its security practices after those previous thefts, and they noted that thieves were able to get the company’s crown jewels through a simple website vulnerability. “Equifax should have multiple layers of controls” so if hackers manage to break in, they can at least be stopped before they do too much damage, Ms. Litan said. Potentially adding to criticism of the company, three senior executives, including the company’s chief financial officer, John Gamble, sold shares worth almost $1.8 million in the days after the breach was discovered. The shares were not part of a sale planned in advance, Bloomberg reported. The company handles data on more than 820 million consumers and more than 91 million businesses worldwide and manages a database with employee information from more than 7,100 employers, according to its website. Equifax also houses much of the data that is supposed to be a backstop against security breaches. The agency offers a service that provides companies with the questions and answers needed for their account recovery, in the event customers lose access to their accounts. “If that information is breached, you’ve lost that backstop,” said Patrick Harding, the chief technology officer at Ping Identity, a Denver-based identity management company. Equifax said that, in addition to reporting the breach to law enforcement, it had hired a cybersecurity firm to conduct a review to determine the scale of the invasion. The investigation is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks. “This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do,” Richard F. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Equifax, said in a statement. “Confronting cybersecurity risks is a daily fight.” Using the data stolen from Equifax, identity thieves can impersonate people with lenders, creditors and service providers, who rely on personal identity information from Equifax to make financial decisions regarding potential customers. Equifax has created a website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, to help consumers determine whether their data was at risk. People can go to the Equifax website to see if their information has been compromised. The site encourages customers to offer their last name and the last six digits of their Social Security number. When they do, however, they do not necessarily get confirmation about whether they were affected. Instead, the site provides an enrollment date for its protection service, and it may not start for several days. The company also suggests getting a free copy of your credit report from the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. These are available at annualcreditreport.com. It also suggests contacting a law enforcement agency if you believe any stolen information has already been used in some way. Equifax’s credit protection service, which is free for one year for consumers who enroll by Nov. 21, is available to everyone and not just the victims of the breach. Equifax is offering consumers the ability to freeze their Equifax credit reports, said John Ulzheimer, a consumer credit expert who often does expert witness work for banks and credit unions and worked at Equifax in the 1990s. Thieves could have information stolen from Equifax and used it to open accounts with creditors that use Experian or TransUnion. “It’s like locking one of three doors in your house and leaving the other two unlocked,” Mr. Ulzheimer said. “You’re hoping the thief stumbles on the locked door.” He recommended that all those affected immediately place a fraud alert on all three of their credit files, which anyone can do for free. Equifax’s offer of one year of free protection falls short of what consumers really need, because their information can be bought and sold by hackers for years to come, Mr. Ulzheimer added. Beyond compromising the personal data of millions of consumers, the breach also poses a potential national security threat. In recent years, Chinese nation-state hackers have breached insurers like Anthem and federal agencies, siphoning detailed personal and medical information. These hackers go wide in their assaults in an effort to build databases of Americans’ personal information, which can be used for blackmail or future attacks. Governments regularly buy stolen personal information on the so-called Dark Web, security experts say. The black market sites where this information is sold are far more exclusive than black markets where stolen credit card data is sold. Interested buyers are even asked to submit to background checks before they are admitted. “Cyberwar is in large part conducted through data mining and cyberintelligence,” Ms. Litan said. “This is also a Homeland Security risk as enemy nation states build databases of Americans that they then use to get to their targets, for example a network operator at a power grid, or a defense contractor at a missile defense company.” Sen. Mark R. Warner, a Virginia Democrat who co-founded the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said he believed the severity of the Equifax breach raised serious questions about whether Congress needed to rethink data protection policies. “It is no exaggeration to suggest that a breach such as this — exposing highly sensitive personal and financial information central for identity management and access to credit — represents a real threat to the economic security of Americans,” he said in a statement.Equifax\\'s $700 million settlement with the U.S. government over a massive 2017 data breach includes up to $425 million for consumers. The breach was one of the largest ever to threaten private information, as the breach exposed Social Security and other data on nearly 150 million people. Affected consumers would get free credit-monitoring and identity-restoration services for the next several years and may be eligible for money they\\'ve already spent on such services. Here is what you need to know about the breach and what actions you can take: According to the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, a server hosting Equifax\\'s online dispute portal was running software with a known weak spot. The hackers, who have not been identified, jumped through the opening. Hiding behind encryption tools, they sent 9,000 queries to dozens of databases containing consumers\\' personal information, and then methodically extracted the information. The attack went unnoticed by Equifax for more than six weeks. Equifax officials told GAO the company made many mistakes. Some were as simple as having an outdated list of computer systems administrators. When the company circulated a notice to install a patch for the software vulnerability, the employees responsible for installing the patch never got it. The company has said it took steps to fix the issues that allowed the breach to occur. That includes adding tools to better monitor network traffic, restrict traffic between internal servers and tighten controls on who can access certain systems and networks. The company also gave consumers more control over their Equifax data and introduced a free credit-alert service. There was also a management shakeup. The chief information officer and top security executive both retired, and Equifax hired a new chief technology officer from IBM. Equifax stores a trove of data that provides a financial profile of millions of consumers, including how much they owe on their homes and whether there are court judgments against them. The compromised data included Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver license numbers and credit card numbers. Equifax said 3,200 passport images were also stolen. Criminals can use those bits of personal information to commit identity theft. Equifax has a page with a link to look up whether your information was exposed. Affected consumers may be eligible for up to $20,000 in reimbursements for losses from unauthorized charges to affected accounts, legal and other fees, credit-monitoring or identity-theft-protection services and expenses related to freezing or unfreezing credit reports. For the time spent dealing with the breach, consumers can seek $25 per hour for up to 20 hours as compensation. All impacted consumers will be eligible to receive 10 years of free credit monitoring, at least seven years of free identity-restoration services, and, starting in 2020, six free copies of their Equifax credit report each year for seven years. That\\'s on top of the free copy consumers can already get by law every 12 months from each of the three big agencies — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. For minors, free credit monitoring increases to 18 years. If consumers choose not to enroll in the free credit monitoring product available through the settlement, they may seek up to $125 as a reimbursement for the cost of a credit-monitoring product of their choice. Consumers must submit a claim in order to receive free credit monitoring or cash reimbursements. What can consumers do with credit reports? Examine all your listed accounts and loans to make sure that the personal information is correct and that you authorized the transaction. If you find something suspicious, contact the company that issued the account and the credit-rating agency. Consider freezing your credit, which stops thieves from opening new credit cards or loans in your name. It can be done online. Consumers can freeze their credit for free because of recent legislation, avoiding fees that were typically $5 to $10 per rating agency. You\\'ll need to remember to temporarily unfreeze your credit, also free, if you apply for a new credit card or loan. And a freeze won\\'t protect you from thieves who file a fraudulent tax return in your name or make charges against an existing account. Was the punishment expected? Yes, Equifax said earlier this year that it had set aside around $700 million to cover anticipated settlements and fines. What\\'s next? The settlement must still be approved by the U.S. District Court in Atlanta. Consumers can\\'t file claims until after the settlement receives court approval '"
